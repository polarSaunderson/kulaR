Description: `kulaR` is largely a wrapper around the "khroma" package to 
    automate common tasks with colours in R. It builds off the existing colour 
    palettes in "khroma"", which are colourblind safe, but provides an 
    alternative, unified syntax for using the palettees. There are also 
    capabilities of creating better automated colour schemes, and to add custom
    colour bars and legends.
