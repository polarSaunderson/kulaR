# kulaR

**PRIVATE BRANCH OF THE pkg02_kulaR PACKAGE**

## Overview
The kulaR package is largely a wrapper around the "khroma"  package to automate common tasks with colours in R. 
It builds off the existing colour palettes in khroma, which are all colourblind friendly, but provides a common syntax for using them. 
It also has capabilities of creating better automated colour schemes, and adding legends.
This package is the first R package that I have created and will likely have issues at the beginning.
